# Simple Mailing Service

## Description

This repository contains a basic implementation of a mailing service. The service allows users to send emails using a straightforward API.

## Architecture Overview

The mailing service is designed with a modular architecture for scalability and maintainability. It consists of the following components:

1.  **API Server**:
    
    -   Responsible for handling incoming requests from clients.
    -   Exposes endpoints for sending emails, managing templates, and accessing email logs.
2.  **Email Service**:
    
    -   Handles the actual sending of emails.
    -   Utilizes a third-party email sending service or an SMTP server for sending emails.
3.  **Template Engine**:
    
    -   Manages email templates.
    -   Allows users to create, edit, and use predefined email templates.
4.  **Database**:
    
    -   Stores user information, templates, and email logs.
    -   Can be implemented using a relational database or a NoSQL database, depending on requirements.
5.  **Authentication and Authorization**:
    
    -   Ensures that only authenticated users can send emails.
    -   Provides role-based access control for managing templates and accessing logs.
6.  **Logging and Monitoring**:
    
    -   Captures email sending events and stores them for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
    -   Can integrate with monitoring tools for real-time alerts.
7.  **Configuration Management**:
    
    -   Allows for easy configuration of SMTP settings, API keys, and other parameters.
